# Python-programming-for-LabJack-T7-PRO
Workspace for exploring Python programming with a LabJack T7-PRO data logger.\

Upon exploring the data rate capabilities of the logger it is believed that there is some underlying hardware issue that can cause initial stream reads to skip/miss some of the scans/samples from time to time. This corresponds to 1-2 seconds of data where skipped/missing scans occured for periods of the stream read.\

Another downside of the LabJack T7 series is when using stream mode (required for high scan/sample rates), the logger cannot provide timestamp information along with the data. This has become an issue for myself. Seemed to be doable by some synchronisation between the host computer and the T7-PRO internal CORE_TIMER, but efforts to do so have failed so far. What is currently in place seems to still be clock drifting in such a short term, despite efforts for re-synchronisation. The current program causes eventual stream buffer overflow, which is a problem as this ends the data aquisition. I am not sure if doing clock synchronization in another thread is a good ieas as if you put the clock synchronization in a separate thread, the unpredictable timing of thread execution could potentially introduce errors into the synchronization process. This could lead to clock drift, where the system clock and the T7-PRO's internal CORE_TIMER gradually become out of sync.
